# Nmap Security Scanner & AI Analyzer

This project allows you to perform an Nmap scan on any IP address you want to test for security. The scan results can be analyzed by an AI to generate a detailed report including CVE information.  

You can export the analysis as **text** or **PDF**, and previously performed scans can be viewed in the **History** section.
